                            <h3>What is mods ?</h3>
                            <p> Most mods add content to the game to alter gameplay, change the creative feel, or give the player more options in how they interact with the Minecraft world. Most people who create mods for Minecraft (known as modders) use Minecraft Coder Pack and either ModLoader or Minecraft Forge to do so.
                            <h4>What is modpacks?</h4>
                            <p>Mod packs are collections of mods that have been put together and configured so that they will all work together. Mod packs are often centered around a general theme like tech, quests, or magic. Mod packs often have either custom launchers or installers that make installing and running the mod pack easy.
                            <h4>Bugs?</h4>
                            <p>If you install a mod, it may stop the game from working properly. If you encounter a problem while using mods and want to report it, first remove all of your mods and see if the problem still happens. If the problem continues to happen, it can be reported on the bug tracker
